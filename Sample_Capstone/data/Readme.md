# data folder
Put data file(s) here in this folder. 

If your data files is too big (github.com basic repo has total size limits of 100MB), then leave your data files in the bigdata folder, which is on the .gitignore list, so that it will not sync to the remote repo. 

If that's the case, then you need to include a small sample for the instructor to inspect. Put the sample data in the sampledata folder then.
